Add breadcrumb navigation links to your wordpress posts and pages in under five minutes!

== Description ==

I needed a way to support breadcrumb navigation, so that I could get a hierarchical list of posts or pages on my wordpress site.  I installed several plugins, and searched the web for an hour or two before getting a tad frustrated by the lack of decent plugins to do such a seemingly simple task!

This prompted me to write my own plugin.  I hope you enjoy it!
